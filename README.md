## Deployment

### Setting Up Database

To deploy this project, you will need to create a database.

For this, you will need to download PostgreSQL [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). We recommend installing PGAdmin4 during the installation process.

Create a database called `calcura` on port number `5432`. If you have a different port number, go to `backend/settings.py` and then change the 'PORT' in the following code to your port number.

```python
DATABASES = {
     'default': {

        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',

        'NAME': 'calcura',

        'USER': 'postgres',

        'PASSWORD': os.getenv('databasepass'), 

        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',

        'PORT': '5432',

    }
}
```



### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variable to your `.env` file.

```
databasepass=["YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD"]
```

You must have quotes around your database password.

### Migrations

Once the database is created and set up, change directory into `backend`. Then, run the following:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations Calcura
python manage.py migrate Calcura
python manage.py makemigrations chatSystem
python manage.py migrate chatSystem
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
## Running The Program

The first time you run the program, you need to create admin account. To do this, first ensure you are in `backend/` then follow the instructions after running the command below

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Then, go to `settings.py`, and uncomment the following lines of code in `Index` function:

```python
a=Administration()
a.save()
```

Then, start the server using
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Open the server (http://127.0.0.1:8000) in a browser and once you see the home page, you know it's working!

Go back and comment back the lines you previously uncommented.
```python
a=Administration()
a.save()
```
Then, in your browser, proceed to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and login with the credentials you previously created.

### Setting Up Google OAuth

In the sidebar of the admin page, proceed to `Social Applications`create a new social application. Select `Google` as the Provider, name it `Calcura`, set the Client ID to
```
894016689644-i7e3dg6d1gb753lvl3cv7v4e0r8re9ue.apps.googleusercontent.com
```
and set Secret Key to 
```
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
```
Double click `example.com` such that it moves to Chosen Sites. Then, click the plus icon to add `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

The website is now fully setup! Every time you want to run the server, in `Calcura/backend` use `python manage.py runserver`.

## Known Bugs

- When clicking to the outside of a sidebar, the screen appears grey and nothing is clickable. To fix this issue on mobile, reload your page. On a laptop, click the "ESC" button. 
- Sometimes, the image carousel of listings temporarily breaks and appears as a white screen without warning. It then fixes itself. It may be a problem associated with flowbite scripts; however, the current nature of the issue isn't known
